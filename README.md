# SystemDesignMap

🗺️ **SystemDesignMap** is an open-source, visual roadmap to learn system design.  
It helps developers understand how real-world applications are built—from architecture fundamentals to full-scale distributed systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Every day, we use apps like Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and GitHub.  
But how are they actually designed? What happens when we tap "send", "search", or "login"?

**SystemDesignMap** was created to explore those answers.

> **Created by Mr. Krishnamohan Yagneswaran**, out of a love for understanding how the software we use every day actually works under the hood.
